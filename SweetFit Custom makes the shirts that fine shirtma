SweetFit Custom makes the shirts that fine shirtmakers sell.

AMAZING QUALITY, AFFORDABLE PRICE.

We have an army of highly trained artisans crafting our shirt. Imagine Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory, but even more fun, and even sweeter. Even with our unparalleled attention to detail, we manage to keep prices down through the judicious use of magic and pixie dust.


WE SPEAK YOUR LANGUAGE

You no speak good English? No problemo! We have staff that can speak Farsi, Bantu, Haitian Creole, Tagalog, 47 dialects of Chinese, and over 3,000 other languages. 


WE UNDERSTAND YOUR BUSINESS
